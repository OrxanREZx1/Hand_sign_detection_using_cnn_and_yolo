# ðŸ§  Sign Language Detection using YOLO

This project focuses on detecting and interpreting sign language gestures using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model. It combines real-time hand detection with gesture classification to recognize sign language letters or commands from video or image input.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

- **Goal**: Recognize sign language using computer vision and deep learning.
- **Approach**:
  - Use YOLO to detect hand regions.
  - Classify gestures based on detected hand features.
  - Map predictions to corresponding sign language symbols.
